# MAC keys configuration


Macbook is terrific piece of hardware with great shiny bright retina screen with resolution of up to 2880x1800 pixels, soft large keyboard and sturdy design. Sill there are few things that will annoy every user that has to connect to windows every now and then using his precious Mac.

1. Applications are not closing when you close all windows
2. Alt-Tab will not un-minimize minimized applications
3. Alt and Windows keys are switched compared to normal keyboard
4. There is no Insert key
5. There is no PrintScreen key

For 1. and 2. we just learn to live with it. With 3. 4. and 5. we will deal in the rest of this document.

3. 4. and 5. will also a problem if you install Windows on Mac laptop (which i did) and we will describe how to fix it in Mac and Windows OS.
